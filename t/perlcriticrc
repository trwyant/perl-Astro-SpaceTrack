[Perl::Critic::Policy::InputOutput::ProhibitInteractiveTest]

# Perl::Critic and Perl Best Practices prefer the IO::Interactive
# is_interactive() subroutine to -T STDIN. But that assumes that
# ARGV is used for input, and that you don't want to be interactive
# if output goes to a pipe. I do not want these assumptions, but
# rather than disable them in the code I am simply assigning them
# a severity slightly higher than I currently use.

[Perl::Critic::Policy::ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitConstantPragma]

# Perl::Critic and Perl Best Practices do not like the 'constant'
# pragma because it does not interpolate. It really does, the
# syntax is just different. Rather than disable the things in the
# source, I'm just assigning them a severity slightly greater than
# I customarily use.
