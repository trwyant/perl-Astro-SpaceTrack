=head1 TITLE

capture - Capture HTTP::Response objects to feed to a mock LWP::UserAgent.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 capture
 capture --help
 capture --version

=head1 OPTIONS

The following options are supported directly by this script. Any
unrecognized options will be passed through to C<Astro::SpaceTrack>.

=head2 --directory

This option specifies the directory in which the responses are to be
written. The default is the default for C<Mock::LWP::UserAgent>.

=head2 --help

This option displays the documentation for this script. The script then
exits.

=head2 --list

If this Boolean option is asserted, the captured objects are listed. The
script then exits. The list includes captured data if
L<--verbose|/--verbose> is also asserted.

=head2 --retrieval-size

This option specifies the maximum number of OIDs to retrieve in a single
query. The default is C<200>.

=head2 --verbose

If this option is asserted, file creation will be logged to standard
error.

=head2 --version

This option displays the version of this script. The script then exits.

=head1 DETAILS

This Perl script is unsupported and may be modified or retracted without
notice at any time. The documentation is simply for the benefit of the
author.

This Perl script is essentially a wrapper for the Astro::SpaceTrack
C<shell()> method. But it uses a subclass of
L<Astro::SpaceTrack|Astro::SpaceTrack> to dump HTTP responses to JSON
files whose name is an MD5 digest of the URL that generated the
response. The files are censored heavily by this subclass.

In addition, the following commands/methods are added:

=head2 GET

This method simply gets the specified URL.

=head2 site_check

This method performs an accessability check on the named site.
