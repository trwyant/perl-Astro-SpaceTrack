The tools/ directory contains tools used to manage the Astro-SpaceTrack
distribution. Its contents are:

README - This file.

all_iridium_classic - A script to retrieve raw status of all
	original-design Iridium satellites from Space Track and write it
	to standard out in a format suitable for inclusion in a canned
	status table in Astro::SpaceTrack. Because Space Track does not
	know the operational status of the satellites, the only status
	values reported will be '[?]' (unknown) or '[D]' (decayed).

capture - A script to execute Space Track queries, censor the results
	heavily, and write the results to the directory and file that
	Mock::LWP::UserAgent (in the inc/ directory of this
	distribution) will read them from. Because the names of the
	files are completely cryptic, it will also list the files with
	their contents. Use tools/capture --help for the documentation.

modeldef - A script to query the Space Track metadata and build a web
	page that describes it.
