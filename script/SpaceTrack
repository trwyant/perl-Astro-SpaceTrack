#		$ perl SpaceTrack 'set username me password secret'
#		followed by whatever commands you like at the SpaceTrack
#		prompt.

=head1 NAME

SpaceTrack - Perl application to fetch satellite orbit data.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This application provides a command-line interface to the
Astro::SpaceTrack module, based on the Astro::SpaceTrack::shell
subroutine.

This gives you interactive access to all Astro::SpaceTrack methods,
plus pseudo output redirection (with tilde expansion) if you want your
output to go to a file.

Commands can be passed in on the command line. After all command-line
commands have been processed, you get an interactive prompt unless one
of the command-line commands was 'exit'. Beginning with 0.014, commands
can also be piped in, or redirected in from a file.

The one and only option is -filter, which sets the 'filter' attribute
of the C<Astro::SpaceTrack> object. This prevents informational output
(such as the banner and 'OK' messages) to STDOUT. The idea is that
with -filter asserted, you can pipe the output to another program,
and only have orbital elements written to the pipe.

Please see L<Astro::SpaceTrack|Astro::SpaceTrack> for the details.
