    RT 127371 Dependency problem when bulding with Module::Build.
    Thanks to Slaven Rezic for finding this (unlike many dependency
    problems it does NOT manifest when run against a base Perl
    installation) and reporting it in such detail that all I had to do
    was pick an implementation. CPAN TESTERS RULE!

    Add Celestrak catalogs 'active' and 'analyst'. 'Active' seems to be
    satellites actually in service, based on correlating this list with
    the Iridium status list. 'Analyst' seems not to be real satellites,
    and may be pathological test cases.

    Make 'decayed' internal status override anything from external
    sources. The idea is that the canned table is from Space Track, and
    therefore authoritative as to whether a satellite is actually
    on-orbit.

    Iridium 8 decayed.

    Sladen tweaks web page; scraper change needed.

    Further deprecate Iridium status from McCants.  Mike McCants has
    announced that he is no longer maintaining his Iridium status. The
    first use of his Iridium status will now generate a warning.  In a
    further 6 months there will be a warning on every use, and 6 months
    after that it will become fatal.

0.100		2017-10-12	T. R. Wyant
    Added Iridium status decayed ('[D]', portable status is 3 --
    BODY_STATUS_IS_DECAYED).

    Add iridium_status() format 'spacetrack'. Space Track has no idea
    whether a given satellite is in service or not, but does know
    whether it has decayed. So the status reported for a given OID is
    from Celestrak if it has it and the satellite is still in orbit.
    If a satellite is not in the Celestrak data but Space Track reports
    it as still in orbit, its status will be unknown ('[?]'), and its
    portable status will be tumbling.

    Add a hard-wired internal Iridium status table having the Space
    Track data. This is used to supplement data from other sources,
    since they typically drop a satellite once it has decayed.

    Add iridium_status() option -raw, which reports statuses
    un-supplemented by Celestrak or canned data to the extent this is
    possible. This option can be specified either command-line style
    (i.e. '-raw') or in a leading hash ref (i.e. '{ raw => 1 }'). This
    is in support of generating the above hard-wired table.

    Add script 'tools/all_iridium_classic', which queries Space Track
    for all Iridium satellites, and reports the status of the
    original-design Iridiums. This is for generating the canned status
    tables in Astro::SpaceTrack and Astro::Coord::ECI::TLE.

    Remove tests for iridium_status( 'mccants' ), since this is both
    unmaintained and deprecated.

  Add dependency on Mozilla::CA in hope to quash some of the CPAN
    testers CERT errors.

  Simplify the -last5 handling code. Rather than defaulting it and then
    removing it if unneeded, just insert it only if the query class ends
    up being 'tle_latest'.

  Fix a problem with bad Space Track queries being generated under
    certain circumstances if TLE data were being requested and class
    'tle' (rather than 'tle_latest') was being used to satisfy them. The
    problem seems to have been the leakage of extraneous data from the
    -last5 option (even if defaulted) into the REST query.
    Thanks to Vidar Tyldum for finding this rather abstruse problem and
    running it to ground.

  Supply missing initialization in JSON code. This was a problem only
    if no data were returned, and maybe then only under restricted and
    poorly-understood corcumstances.

  Fix warnings in McCants' Iridium status code under Perl 5.21.7 and up.
    With this Perl, sprintf() started complaining about extraneous
    arguments.

  Add new spacetrack() catalogs bright_geosynchronous, human_spaceflight
    and well_tracked_objects. The first two correspond to Space Track
    curated queries; the last does not, but is based on their Face Book
    entry for December 3 2014, and represents objects that can not be
    assigned to a country or launch site.

  Fix option hash validation warning in spacetrack(). This affected
    catalog 'payload'.

  Fix exception in names() when an unsupported argument is passed. The
    desired functionality was to return a 404 error, which is now
    implememted and documented.

  Change verify_hostname default back to true, since it appears that
    Perl is accepting Mike McCants' Cert again.

0.088		2014-08-31	T. R. Wyant

  Use global variable $SPACETRACK_DELAY_SECONDS to control the delay
    between Space Track queries. This is initialized from environment
    variable SPACETRACK_DELAY_SECONDS if it is true; otherwise it is
    initialized to 3.

  Throttle Space Track queries to 1 every 3 seconds.  Space Track
    announced August 19 2014 that they intend to throttle queries to
    less than 20 per minute per user as of September 22 2014.  They seem
    to have jumped the gun though, since throttling seems necessary now.

  Remove all RCS-specific functionality.  This includes making -rcs do
    nothing. On August 18 2014 Space Track started returning 0 for RCS,
    instead going for "small," "medium," and "large" in a new JSON
    field.  The -rcs option is now deprecated, and being put through the
    usual deprecation cycle.

  Set default value of verify_hostname attribute to false. This is
    because Perl does not accept Mike McCants' GoDaddy certificate. The
    default can be overridden using environment variable
    SPACETRACK_VERIFY_HOSTNAME if it is defined.

  Remove all references to obsolete spacetrack() canned queries
    full_fast and geosynchronous_fast in the documentation. The queries
    themselves are long gone.

  Prepare for removal of the RCSVALUE datum in Space Track's satcat
    data, which is announced for August 18 2014.

  Add 'prompt' attribute.

  Add ISS data to celestrak_supplemental.

  Support the various Space Track data formats. This involves providing
    a -format option, with values corresponding to the Space Track
    formats, plus 'legacy' (the default) to provide what is essentially
    the Version 1 data format. The old -json option is equivalent to
    -format json.

  When mccants() and friends return data from cache, fabricate

  Try to address test failures in mccants() under older Windows (plus
    one under FreeBSD) due to unseekability of the handle produced by
    open my $fh, '+<', \( $resp->content() );

  Fix problem in the login() method detecting a Space Track login
    failure.

  Add method mccants() to access TLE, magnitude, and RCS data mainteined
    by Mike McCants on his web site. Because these do not get updated
    that often, there is a 'file' option which, if specified, caches the
    results and fetches them from the web only if the cache is stale.

  Add 'file' option (as above) to amsat() and celestrak_supplemental().

  Add cache_hit() and associated machinery to determine whether
    information came from the web or from a file.

  Add information on celestrak() catalog 'argos'.

    functionality. This only works for the Space Track version 2
    interface.

  Add to the spacetrack() method for version 2 of the interface those
    bulk data catalogs which are represented by 'Global Favorites'.

  Add 'YUN' (Yunsong, DPRK) to hard-coded list of launch sites returned
    by the Space Track REST interface.

  Re-instate the use of hour, minute, and second spacifications in
    -start_epoch and -end_epoch for the Space Track REST interface.

  Go back to using OID ranges in the retrieve() method if the Space
    Track REST interface is being used.

  Document environment varoables SPACETRACK_REST_RANGE_OPERATOR and
    SPACETRACK_REST_FRACTIONAL_DATE, so users can get themselves going
    again if there are further glitches in the related functionality.

  Add method celestrak_supplemental() to retrieve the supplemental TLEs
    not derived from SpaceTrack.

  Correct bug in celestrak() method, in which the Space Track REST
    options were being parsed when they should not have been. This was
    really two bugs: use of get() rather than getv() to check the Space

  Fix bug that allowed Kelso's Iridium status to "bleed through" into
    the McCants status data.

0.066		2012-10-15	T. R. Wyant
  Add methods country_names() and launch_sites(), to return the
    expansions of the relevant abbreviations in either tabular form or
    JSON. Under space_track_version == 2, launch_sites() is hard-coded,
    since this information is not available under the REST interface.

  The box_score() method now takes option -json, to return the data in
    JSON format. If space_track_version == 1, the JSON is made up from
    the tabular data.

0.065		2012-10-09	T. R. Wyant
  Retract the merging of names from observing lists (in celestrak() and
    file()) in REST queries, since we can now get them direct from the
    REST interface in all cases. This was introduced in 0.062, with the
    statement that it was temporary.

  Don't use OID ranges in REST queries, since they do not work in
    combination with comma-separated lists.

  Change the size of a retrieve() batch to 200, since larger queries
    seem to be faster.

  Add method update(). This works with the REST interface only, and
    therefore ignores the space_track_version setting. It takes as its
    argument the name of a JSON file containing TLE data, and updates it
    using '/FILE/>...'. The return is whatever format you want.

  Make the REST options work with the spacetrack() method.

  Enable the -sort and -descending options on REST queries. These were
    previously hard-wired (to -sort epoch -descending) because of
    problems early in the beta, which seem to be solved.

  Recode the REST versions of spacetrack( 'full' ) and spacetrack(
    'geosynchronous' ) to go through class satcat to eliminate bodies
    that have decayed. Provide 'full_fast' and 'geosynchronous_fast' for
    those who like to live dangerously. The last two are considered
    experimental, and may be retracted.

  Get the object name from field OBJECT_NAME when using the Space Track
    REST interface, in all cases.

  Make use of the new TLE_LINE0 field in the tle and tle_latest classes
    to have the version 2 retrieve() method return common names.

  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: In JSON output, the object name is now in field
    OBJECT_NAME. Previously there was no object name in the tle data,
    and I was hammering it into field SATNAME, since that is where it
    was in the satcat data.

  Give spacetrack_query_v2() the ability to add header pragmas if it
    discovers it was called from outside the Astro::SpaceTrack name
    space.  It adds 'spacetrack-type = modeldef' if the query is
    'basicspacedata => "modeldef"', and 'spacetrack-type = orbit' if the
    query is 'basicspacedata => "query", class => 'tle'" or '... class
    => "tle_latest"'.

  Change attribute verify_hostname's default value to true again, since
    Space Track says they have their act together.

  Correct documented name of class used to retrieve current TLE data
    using the Space Track REST interface. It's 'tle_latest', not
    'tle_current'.

0.064		2012-09-05	T. R. Wyant
  Add REST support for as many of the spacetrack() bulk data sets as I
    can figure out. The analysis is in Astro::SpaceTrack::BulkData.

  The default -status for a REST query is now 'onorbit'. The default for
    version 1 queries remains 'all'.

  Space Track REST queries now use the 'tle_latest' class unless
    historical data are needed, as indicated by use of -start_epoch,
    -end_epoch, -since_file, or some -status other than 'onorbit'.

  Add 'time' and 'olist' meta-commands to the shell() method. The latter
    is experimental, and may go away.

  Eliminate superfluous REST queries issued by search_name() and
    search_oid(). These were introduced in 0.060_07.

  Suppress appending of '--rcs' to the common name by the REST interface
    when RCSVALUE is null.

  Fix problem with merging names from an observing list into JSON REST
    data.

0.063		2012-08-29	T. R. Wyant
  Imposed Space Track REST cookie expiration of an hour. The cookie
    appears to come with no expiration, but the docs say it's only good
    for about 2 hours.

  Followed change to representation if International Launch Designator
    (INTLDES) in Space Track REST class tle. It was yyyy-lllp, but is
    now yylllp, just like Space Track version 1.

0.062		2012-08-25	T. R. Wyant
  Fix the joining of JSON data when one of the lists is empty.

  Have the celestrak() and file() methods supply common names from their
    sources if the with_name attribute is true and the
    space_track_version attribute is 2. This functionality will be
    retracted when (and if) the Space Track REST interface becomes
    capable of supplying NASA-format TLEs.

  Document the fact that Space Track has deprecated bulk data downloads,
    and plans to remove them in October 2012. This will break the
    spacetrack() method.

  Use more recent datas for launch date and historical query tests in
    t/query.t, since it seems that Space Track purged the version 2 TLE
    database on August 24 2012.

0.061		2012-08-15	T. R. Wyant
  Reinstate the headings returned by -notle searches done with
    space_track_version set to 1. These were lost in version 0.060_09.

  When the space_track_version attribute is 2, implement the -exclude
    search option in terms of the OBJECT_TYPE field rather than by
    simulating the version 1 exclusion rules in the client. This can
    mean different search results depending on the interface used (e.g.
    Westford needles are debris under v1, but payload under v2), but
    since the change seems to be deliberate on the part of Space Track,
    I am following it.

0.060_12	2012-08-07	T. R. Wyant
  Turn on autoflush in t/query.t to try to prevent overwriting of
    prompt.

  Have the REST version of retrieve() issue multiple queries if the
    number of OIDs is over 50.

  Add the ability to handle OID ranges to the REST versions of
    retrieve() and search_oid().

  Have the output of names( 'spacetrack' ) depend on the value of the
    space_track_version attribute.

  Have the shell() method extract redirections from the command line
    before un-quoting and un-escaping the data, so that we have a way to
    force something that looks like a redirection to be taken as an
    argument.

  Add ':' to the list of 'safe' characters when URI-escaping arguments
    to the Space Track REST interface. Percent-encoded colons seemed to
    stop working some time between 13:15 and 19:15 GMT on July 27 2012.
    Un-encoded colons go through fine.

  Accept ':' as well as '/' as punctuation between username and password
    in environment variable SPACETRACK_USER.

  Have t/query.t try to load Term::ReadKey. If successful, it uses it to
    turn off password echoing. If not successful, it adds '(ECHOED)' to
    the prompt.

  Fix problem associating RCS data with TLEs when using version 1 of the
    Space Track interface and the OID in the search results is less than
    five digits.

  Change default value of verify_hostname attribute to false. And about
    time.

  Add attribute 'pretty' to reqest that JSON text (and potentially
    others) be pretty-formatted.

  Expose the name of the Space Track session cookie as an attribute.
    This is one of those attributes which have distinct values for each
    value of space_track_version.

  Have the parser for the retrieve() -start_epoch and -end_epoch options
    accept time of day as well as just date. Pass time of day to the
    server when using the Space Track REST interface.

  Further deprecate celestrak( 'sts' ) and spaceflight( 'shuttle' ) so
    that they give a warning every time they are used.

  If both -json and -rcs are in effect, return RCSSOURCE as well as
    RCSVALUE.

  Have the attribute_names() method take account of the fact that the
    'cookie_expires' attribute does not exist if the space_track_version
    attribute is set to 2.

  Ignore the -sort and -descending retrieve() options when using the
    Space Track REST interface. As things now stand, I have to force the
    equivalent of -sort=epoch -descending when retrieve()-ing multiple
    OIDs to get sane results.

  Add a -json retrieve() option, valid only if the REST interface is in
    use. This also works with celestrak() and file() if the
    space_track_version attribute is 2, but with celestrak() the usual
    restrictions on retrieve() options apply.

  Retrieve TLEs for multiple OIDs in a single call to the Space Track
    REST interface.

  Require HTTP::Status 6.03, because I can't forebear to use the
    "teapot" status for testing purposes.

  Expose spacetrack_query_v2(), which is our lowest-level interface to
    Space Track version 2.

  Use JSON rather than YAML for serialization in (e.g.)
    t/spacetrack_request.t, since the former is now a requirement, but
    the latter never was.

  Bit-mapped the unsupported dump_headers attribute.

  Eliminated the unsupported debug_url attribute.

  Implement epoch selection of TLEs via the Space Track REST interface.

  Run all the Space Track REST arguments through URI::Escape, which has
    been added as a requirement.

  Try to detect Space Track login failure due to a host verification
    problem, and recommend setting the verify_hostname attribute false.

  Correct erroneous skip() outside SKIP: block in t/query.t.

  Add JSON as dependency. It's used by the Space Track V2 interface.

  Provide access to Space Track v2 REST interface, which is currently in
    beta. This involves adding attribute space_track_version. Attributes
    cookie_expires, domain_space_track, and session_cookie now have
    separate values for each possible value of space_track_version.
    Due to limitations of the version 2 interface, bulk data downloads
    throw an exception, and the with_name attribute is ignored by
    retrieve().

  Add a logout() method, which deletes all the session cookies. I
    considered having it only delete the session cookie for the current
    space_track_version, but decided that this was too confusing.

  Fix problem with Astro::SpaceTrack file() method passing its options
    hash to the retrieve() method as an OID. This was probably
    introduced in version 0.020.

  Bump Test::More requirement from 0.88 to 0.96 so I can do subtests.

  Add method content_interface, which returns the version of the Space
    Track interface use to fetch the data. If Space Track was not
    involved, returns undef.

  Add verify_hostname option to SpaceTrackTk settings window. Add
    'Settings ...' button to login screen.

0.060		2012-06-09	T. R. Wyant
  Add Astro::SpaceTrack attribute verify_hostname. This controls the
    corresponding SSL option for LWP::UserAgent. By default it is true,

  Further deprecate the Astro::SpaceTrack celestrak( 'sts' ) and
    spaceflight( 'shuttle' ) functionality by having them display a
    warning on first use. The next step (warning on every use) will be
    taken on or after July 22 2012.

  Expand ranges passed to the search_oid() method, since the Space Track
    API does not support them.

  Bring Changes file into compliance with Test::CPAN::Changes. Add
    author test xt/author/changes.t to be sure it remains so.

    With the end of the U.S. Space Shuttle program, deprecate the

    Add Astro::SpaceTrack method getv() to do what get() should have
	done -- return the attribute value without wrapping it in an
	HTTP::Response object.

    Add the -rcs option to the Astro::SpaceTrack search_*() methods, to
	request that the radar cross-section data be hacked into the
	name line of the TLE, in the same way that the effective date is
	for Human Space Flight TLEs.

    Complete rewrite of SpaceTrackTk, to incorporate all (or at least
	the great majority) of the modern bells and whistles.

    Update banner text to try to make clear that only Space Track
	requires registration before use.

    Update documentation to show all content_types.

    Drop requirement for Params::Util.

    Require Perl 5.6.2, since that is the earliest version I have  a
	prayer of actually supporting.

    Move author tests from xt/ to xt/author.

0.046		2010-03-28	T. R. Wyant
    Add methods search_decay(), search_oid(), and box_score().

    Replace '' with undef in the array returned by the search_* methods
	in list context. The HTTP::Response returned by these methods
	is unchanged.

    Add -notle option to the search_* methods. This causes them to
        return the results of the search, rather than going on to
	retrieve the TLEs. The results are one entry per line with
	fields tab-delimited, and whitespace compressed and trimmed
	front and back. No change in the list returned in list context,
	except for the whitespace massaging.

    Redo README to be more like the CPAN-recommended organization and
        contents.

    Move developer tests to xt/, and run them with Build target
        authortest, supplied by inc/My/Module/Build.pm. The author tests
        are not supported with make.

    Split off the data acquisition tests from t/basic.t into t/query.t.
        Both these, plus xt/celestrak_datasets.t and xt/executable.t
        were rewritten to use Test::More 0.40, which is now required for
        building (or at least testing!) the package.

    Make some of the tests in t/query.t TODO, since they require
        historical data, and Space Track seems to have had a database
        problem.

    Convert all code to the CPAN-recommended license scheme. Update all
        copyrights while I was at it.

    Make the version of all production code in the package (including
        Astro::SpaceTrack::Parser, which was previously unversioned) to
        be the same as the package itself.

    Update the counts for the various debris events that are documented

        Add this to line 0 of the NASA TLE as --effective date_text.
        This is optional, and done only if '-effective' is passed
