This directory contains examples of how to use Astro::SpaceTrack. The
following examples are provided:

celestrak
    This script retrieves data from Celestrak.com. By default, it
    retrieves the list of 100 (or so) brightest. You can also
    specify one or more lists to retrieve on the command line. If
    you specify a non-existent list you will get an error stating
    what lists are available.

spacetrack-identity
    This script prints the username and password in a format appropriate
    to create environment variable SPACETRACK_USER via a shell eval.

sh_script
    This shell script illustrates the retrieval of data for the
    International Space Station directly from the Space Track web site
    using the SpaceTrack application. Output can be redirected to a
    file. This script requires environment variable SPACETRACK_USER to
    be set to a valid Space Track username/password (separated by "/"),
    and will complain if this is not done. It also requires file
    sh_data to be in the default directory.

sh_data
    This text file contains the SpaceTrack commands used by sh_script.

SpaceTrackTk
    This Perl script is a Perl/Tk client for the Space Track
    functionality.
